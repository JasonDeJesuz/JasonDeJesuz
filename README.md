Hi, I’m Jason De Jesuz — a software engineer, builder, and unapologetic operator. I don’t overcomplicate things — I ship. Fast, lean, and with purpose.

## What I Do

- Fractional CTO for startups that need results, not theory. I’ve led V1s from zero to shipped in weeks, not quarters.
- Founder of multiple products with real users and real revenue. Trading apps, AI tools, social dev utilities, wellness tech — I’ve built it, shipped it, and iterated on it.
- Architected backends that scale, frontends that feel good, and flows that automate what used to take teams.
- Deeply technical. Even deeper into delivery. My work always ends in something real getting into users’ hands.

## Things I've Built

- An arbitrage scanner across 20+ exchanges with WebSockets + AI that’s helped real people profit in crypto.
- A calorie tracker with computer vision and GPT integration. Over $10K revenue, self-funded.
- Internal tooling that’s closed deals, cut costs, and automated the stuff people usually outsource.
- Conversational agents that write reports, generate insights, and reduce human workload in actual business ops.

## My Edge

- I think in outcomes. Not tasks. Not tickets. Not “roadmaps.”
- I bring context, speed, and pragmatism into everything I touch — whether I’m engineering, leading, or advising.
- I know when to be hands-on and when to stay out the way. I’ve done both, and I do both well.
- I use AI to move faster, not to fake competence.

## Stack I Reach For

TypeScript · Convex · NestJS · Expo · React Native · Supabase · Resend · Stripe · Clerk · OpenAI · LangChain · Docker · Pulumi · PostgreSQL · Retool

## Currently

- Running lean cycles with async teams across timezones.
- Building infra and AI agents for wellness, education, and trading apps.
- Cutting out complexity. Prioritizing clarity. Reinvesting in health, strength, and spiritual balance.

## Always

- Write the logic. Understand the system. Don’t hide behind frameworks.
- Think like a founder. Execute like an engineer. 
- Keep it real. Keep it moving. Ship.
